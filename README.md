# RhythmGame
Code Written By Matthew Markowitz. This is a program where the user can try to press the a button in sync with falling notes. These notes are timed with the rhythm of music that the player loads. The music must contain an associated .time file that indicates the timing of the beats. A gamepad is required for input in this game. Multiplayer is also supported for up to 4 people.
